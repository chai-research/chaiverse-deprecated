## Quick Start With Run Pod
### Just watch the following 3 minutes tutorial, our repo is made to run on runpod üöÄüöÄ 
[![Watch this video](https://imgur.com/mBwiQby.png)](https://vimeo.com/858817518?share=copy)

1. login to your runpod.io account then go to https://www.runpod.io/console/gpu-cloud
2. From "GPU Cloud", select "Community Cloud", and choose the required GPU to deploy the RunPod Pytorch 2.0.1 Template.For Lora and Reward model training, 1 x A40 is enough!

3. Click "Customize Deployment"

   Change "Container Image" to "chaiverse/runpod", and "Container Disk" and "Volume Disk" to "100GB". Then click "set Overrides" to save the changes.

## Model Training
Currently we support efficient training with Lora, for Causallm model and reward model training.
The sample codes can be found under `src/chaiverse/examples`

### ü¶ô Fit a causallm model
Nice and easy pipeline to train a causallm model(e.g. llama) and push it to huggingface within hours ü•≥

The [example notebook](https://github.com/chai-research/chaiverse/blob/clean_dev_main/src/chaiverse/examples/example_lora_llama.ipynb) to fit a Llama7b model and push it to huggingface.

### üéÅ Reward Model Training
We also implemented a reward model training pipeline which helps to boost your model's performance even more!

The [example notebook](https://github.com/chai-research/chaiverse/blob/clean_dev_main/src/chaiverse/examples/example_reward_model.ipynb) running through the pipeline.

## Winning Prizes with Chai Guanaco
Check out [Chai Prize](https://www.chai-research.com/competition.html), the world's first open community challenge with real-user evaluations hosted by Chai! Your models will be directly deployed on the Chai App where our over 500K daily active users will be providing live feedback. Get to the top of the leaderboard and share the $1 million cash prize!

The model submission is managed by the [chai-guanaco](https://pypi.org/project/chai-guanaco/) package. Run `pip install chai-guanaco` to install.

It provides a way to easily submit your language model, all you need to do is ensure it is on HuggingFace ü§ó. We will automatically Tritonize your model for fast inference and host it in our internal GPU cluster üöÄ

Once deployed, Chai users on our platform who enter the arena mode will be rating your model directly, providing you with both quantitative and verbal feedback üìà Both the public leaderboard and user feedback for your model can be directly downloaded via the chai_guanaco package üß†

Cash prizes will be allocated according to your position on the leaderboard üí∞

### üöÄ Quick Start with Colab
- Join the [Chai Prize Discord](https://discord.com/invite/chai-llm), our bot will greet you and give you a developer key ü•≥
- Submit a model in < 10 minutes with [Chai Prize Jupyter Notebook Quickstart](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FyCamT6icUo5Wlt6qqogHbyREHQQkAY8?usp=sharing)
- Run through our [Chai Prize Prompt Engineering Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eMRidYrys3b1mPrhUOJnfAB3Z7tcCNn0?usp=sharing) to submit models with custom prompts
- Run through our [Chai Prize: Reward Model Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lWzRoP0RZ7jVxhas_zQaG2OyvqxaxhT/view?usp=sharing) to submit reward models! ‚ù§Ô∏è
